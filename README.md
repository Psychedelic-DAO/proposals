# Community Proposals - Psychedelic

This repository holds a record of all the discussed community proposals derived from the **Psychedelic DAO organization and the collective of developers and entrepeneurs building on the Internet Computer ecosystem** seeking to propose improvements, new standards, or technology explorations on the Internet Computer blockchain network.

## The First Proposal - Principal IDs as Unique Identifiers.

You can find the [first proposal here!](https://github.com/Psychedelic-DAO/proposals/blob/main/proposals/principal-ids-as-universal-identifiers.md) 

The community's first conjoint proposal is a standard for using Principal ID’s as the universal unique identifier for the Internet Computer, instead of using Account ID’s, Wallet ID’s, User ID’s, or any other additional unique identifier that is currently being used for ICP, tokens, apps, cycles, etc.. 

Furthermore this proposal aims to establish an alternative approach to user identity/authentication on the Internet Computer that moves away from the hostname specific Principal ID’s currently being used by Internet Identity, and instead optimizes/caters more to the Web3/crypto/token/composability side of the Internet Computer ecosystem by following the Web3 identity/auth/UX patterns users are already familiar with.
